## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Comprehensive data cleaning was performed to ensure data quality, consistency, and analytical readiness.

| Step | Action Taken | Purpose |
|------|-------------|---------|
| 1 | Filtered dataset to years **1991‚Äì2019** only | Restricted to modern Lok Sabha elections |
| 2 | Removed duplicate candidate entries | Ensure unique records |
| 3 | Standardized text columns (`State_Name`, `Party`, `Candidate`) | Consistency for grouping and filters |
| 4 | Dropped rows missing essential data (`Year`, `State_Name`, `Party`, `Candidate`) | Maintain data quality |
| 5 | Replaced missing non-critical fields with `Unknown` | Preserve structure |
| 6 | Converted numeric fields to correct types (`Votes`, `Margin`, `Electors`) | Support aggregation |
| 7 | Added derived columns (`Vote_Share_Calc`, `Is_Winner`) | Enable analytical queries |
| 8 | Removed unrealistic values (`Turnout_Percentage > 100`) | Clean anomalies |

### Verification Checks Passed ‚úÖ
- ‚úì Valid years: 1991, 1996, 1998, 1999, 2004, 2009, 2014, 2019

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Derived/Calculated Columns

These columns were added during preprocessing to enable efficient querying:

| Column | Calculation | Purpose |
|--------|------------|---------|
| `Vote_Share_Calc` | `(Votes / Valid_Votes) √ó 100` | Validate reported vote shares |
| `Is_Winner` | `IF Position = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0` | Fast winner filtering |

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Indexing Strategy

For optimal query performance, the following columns are indexed:

- **Primary Index**: `(Year, State_Name, Constituency_Name, Candidate)`
- **Secondary Indexes**: 
  - `Year` (time-series queries)
  - `Party` (party-wise aggregations)
  - `Is_Winner` (winner filtering)
  - `Constituency_Name` (constituency lookups)

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Common Query Patterns

### Get Winners by Year and Party
```sql
SELECT * FROM election_loksabha_data
WHERE Year = 2019 AND Is_Winner = 1 AND Party = 'BJP';
```

### Calculate Party-wise Seat Share
```sql
SELECT Party, COUNT(*) as Seats
FROM election_loksabha_data
WHERE Year = 2019 AND Is_Winner = 1
GROUP BY Party
ORDER BY Seats DESC;
```

### Analyze Gender Representation Over Time
```sql
SELECT Year, Sex, COUNT(*) as Winners
FROM election_loksabha_data
WHERE Is_Winner = 1
GROUP BY Year, Sex
ORDER BY Year, Sex;
```

### Find Close Contests (Margin < 5%)
```sql
SELECT Year, State_Name, Constituency_Name, Candidate, Party, Margin_Percentage
FROM election_loksabha_data
WHERE Is_Winner = 1 AND Margin_Percentage < 5
ORDER BY Margin_Percentage ASC;
```

## üìù Notes & Best Practices

1. **Performance**: Always filter by `Year` first for optimal query performance
2. **Vote Share**: Use `Vote_Share_Percentage` (pre-calculated) rather than computing on the fly
3. **Winners**: Filter using `Is_Winner = 1` rather than `Position = 1` (indexed column)
4. **Text Search**: Constituency and candidate names are case-insensitive searchable
